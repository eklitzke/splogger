* Lots of cleanups needed to make it fail more gracefully (right now almost any
  sort of failure whatsoever will result in a call to exit(EXIT_FAILURE)). It
  should be possible to recover from a lot of the errors that are encountered.
  This is especially important for a daemon which is expected to stay up 24x7.

* There's almost no client support at the moment, other than splogger_msg which
  is a debugging tool to send log messages to the splogger system. Need to
  update splogger_msg to use the new message type system. Need to write a
  Python module for interacting with the splogger system.

* Add logging to sploggerd. It should log basic things like parse errors and
  when it gets HUPed. Should probably log to syslog (!) by default, with, an
  option to use itself for logging.

* With respect to error handling and logging, the following sorts of errors
  should definitely be recoverable and when they are encountered the error
  should be logged and the daemon should proceed gracefully:
   - Parse errors should be logged and those lines should be ignored
   - Unknown message types should be redirected to a special log (so we don't
     ever lose data) and the event should be logged

* Better signal handling.
